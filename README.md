# AboutME
🔹WHO AM I? 🎭

If data has a schema, consider me the primary key of my own story. Hi, I’m Pranavi—Data Engineer by profession, Data Analyst at heart, and an aspiring Data Scientist fueled by curiosity (and coffee)! ☕📊

I thrive on turning chaos into clarity—whether it’s a tangled dataset or a messy to-do list. I can’t rest until things are clean and structured. It’s the same with data. I love wrangling unstructured information and transforming it into something that’s insightful, accessible, and actionable. Because clean, optimized data isn’t just easier to work with—it’s the foundation of smarter decisions.

🔹WHAT SETS ME APART? 🚀

I bridge the gap between engineering precision and analytical curiosity. I build scalable pipelines as a Data Engineer, but I also dive deep into data exploration and visualization like an Analyst—and I’m continuously growing toward predictive modeling and experimentation as a future Data Scientist.🧠

I optimize ETL workflows, ensure data quality, and deliver insights that drive action. Whether I’m automating backend processes or uncovering business trends, I bring a mindset of efficiency, clarity, and impact. Collaboration is key to everything I do—because better data, like better decisions, comes from working together.

🔹HOW DID I GET HERE? 🔍

I’ve always been the “why?” and “how?” person—more interested in systems and outcomes than surface answers. My interest in data sparked during university, when a project involving real-world datasets made me realize that the real magic wasn’t just in analyzing results, but in cleaning, structuring, and optimizing data to get there. That curiosity led me to engineering pipelines, exploring insights, and now—pursuing data science to build models that predict what’s next. 📈

🔹DATA IN EVERYDAY LIFE 📊

To me, data isn’t just work—it’s a mindset. I track my habits, experiment with patterns (like coffee intake vs. productivity), and constantly look for ways to optimize how I live and work. That’s the beauty of this field—whether it’s business outcomes or personal habits, data can guide smarter decisions. And I love being part of that journey from raw numbers to real insights.

🔹WHAT I'VE ACHIEVED SO FAR: 🏆

📌 Optimized ETL pipelines, reducing processing time by 30%—accelerating analytics and reporting cycles.

📌 Designed scalable data solutions on AWS & Azure to increase accessibility and reduce manual overhead.

📌 Created dashboards and reports that helped stakeholders visualize KPIs and customer trends.

📌 Built machine learning pipelines, improving model accuracy and customer engagement by 15%.

📌 Ensured data quality and compliance, enabling business teams to trust and act on their insights.

🔹WHERE I’M HEADED 🔮

I’m expanding into data science—learning advanced analytics, machine learning, and model deployment. I’m especially interested in using predictive models to improve business outcomes and customer experience. With my engineering foundation, analytical mindset, and constant curiosity, I’m building toward a future where I can deliver insights and intelligence.

Data isn’t just numbers—it’s a story waiting to be told, and I’m here to help shape that narrative. If you geek out over scalable data, pipelines, or a coffee vs. sleep debate, let’s connect!🤝
