# AboutME
🔹WHO AM I? 🎭

If data has a schema, consider me the primary key of my own story. Hi, I’m Pranavi—Data Engineer by profession, problem-solver by passion, and coffee-fueled optimizer by habit!💻

If there’s one thing I thrive on, it’s turning chaos into clarity—whether it’s a messy dataset or my weekend plans. I can’t rest if my room is cluttered—I have to clean it before I can focus. Same with data. Unstructured, messy datasets? I won’t stop until they’re clean, optimized, and analysis-ready. Because good data, like a well-organized space, makes everything work better.

🔹WHAT SETS ME APART? 🚀

I don’t just process data; I engineer solutions. I optimize ETL pipelines, automate workflows, and design scalable systems to ensure efficiency. Faster, smarter, better—that’s my approach to everything.💡

But beyond code, I value collaboration—whether brainstorming data strategies in meetings or planning team hangouts. Data engineering (and life!) is better when shared. Great ideas come from working together, and I bring that mindset everywhere—be it pipelines or parties!

🔹HOW DID I GET HERE? 🔍

I’ve always been the “why?” and “how?” person—curious about processes, not just outcomes. That led me to data engineering. During university, a project analyzing datasets clicked—it wasn’t just about the insights, but how the data got there, how it was structured, and could be optimized. That curiosity evolved into a passion, and that passion became my career.🎓

🔹DATA ENGINEERING IN REAL LIFE 📊

Being a data engineer means looking at everything through a data-driven lens—including my own habits. I realized I knew more about my coffee consumption than my sleep patterns (thanks to self-tracking). But hey, at least I optimized my caffeine intake for maximum productivity! 😆

That’s the beauty of data—it’s not just about handling numbers, but about improving efficiency, uncovering patterns, and making decisions, whether for business, projects, or even personal habits.

🔹WHAT I'VE ACHIEVED SO FAR: 🏆

📌 Optimized ETL pipelines, reducing processing time by 30%, leading to faster insights and decisions.

📌 Designed scalable solutions on AWS & Azure, making data more accessible and reducing overhead.

📌 Built machine learning pipelines, improving predictive accuracy and customer engagement by 15%.

📌 Ensured data quality and governance, enabling businesses to trust their data to drive strategies.

Data isn’t just numbers—it’s a story waiting to be told, and I’m here to help shape that narrative. If you geek out over scalable data, pipelines, or a coffee vs. sleep debate, let’s connect!🤝
